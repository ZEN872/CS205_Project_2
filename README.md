# CS205_Project_2

For this project, I ran the cod using WSL and python3. I set up a viral environment that used PyTorch and CUDA to increase the speed of the code. 

# Set UP environment 
*Requires NVIDIA GPU*

python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade pip

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

pip3 install pandas

# Launch the Code:

To launch the code, you will use this command: *python3 Cuda_Project_2.py*

# Source of the UCI dataset 

That Rocket League data set is originally for this repo: https://github.com/Romathonat/RocketLeagueSkillsDetection
